# ByteFix Website Update Game Plan

This document outlines the steps to update the Gatsby website "ByteFix-Website" to align with the ByteFix brand guidelines.

        *   Secondary: `#212529` (Dark Gray)
        *   Accent: `#F8F9FA` (Light Gray)
    *   The `src/pages/index.js` file now includes inline styles for the color palette.

    *   Import the Montserrat (Bold) and Roboto (Regular) fonts into the project using the `gatsby-plugin-google-fonts` plugin in `gatsby-config.js`.

    *   Update the body text to use clear, concise language and avoid technical jargon.
    *   Update the call-to-action (CTA) button text to be action-oriented (e.g., "Request a Repair").

### Framer Motion Integration Guide

1.  **Install Framer Motion:**
    ```bash
    npm install motion
    ```
2.  **Import `motion`:** Import the `motion` component from `motion/react` in your `src/pages/index.js` file (or any component where you want to add animations).
    ```javascript
    import { motion } from "motion/react"
    ```
3.  **Use `motion` components:** Replace standard HTML elements with their `motion` counterparts (e.g., `motion.div`, `motion.h1`, `motion.button`).
4.  **Apply animation variants:** Define animation variants using the `variants` prop and apply them using the `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props.  For example:

    ```javascript
    const fadeIn = {
      hidden: { opacity: 0 },
      visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { duration: 0.5 } },
    }

    <motion.h1
      variants={fadeIn}
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
    >
      ByteFix
    </motion.h1>
    ```
5.  **Customize animations:**  Adjust animation properties (duration, delay, easing, etc.) within the `transition` object to achieve the desired effects.
