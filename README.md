# ByteFix Website

This is the Gatsby website for ByteFix, a tech solutions provider. This project was created using the Gatsby hello-world starter and has been updated to reflect the ByteFix brand guidelines.

## Project Structure

*   `gatsby-config.js`: Gatsby configuration file.
*   `src/pages/index.js`: The landing page for the website, now implementing the ByteFix brand.
*   `docs/`: Directory containing project documentation.
    *   `BRAND_GUIDELINES.md`: Contains the ByteFix brand guidelines.
    *   `GAMEPLAN.md`: Contains the website update game plan and future improvement suggestions.

## Current Status

*   The website's landing page (`src/pages/index.js`) has been updated with the ByteFix brand's color palette, typography, and placeholder content.
*   The `gatsby-plugin-google-fonts` plugin has been added and configured to load the Montserrat and Roboto fonts.

## Next Steps

1.  Run `gatsby develop` to start the development server.
2.  View the website in your browser to see the changes.
3.  Manually replace the placeholder logo and images with the actual brand assets.
4.  Continue implementing the game plan outlined in `docs/GAMEPLAN.md` to further update the website, including adding service descriptions, testimonials, and a repair request form.
