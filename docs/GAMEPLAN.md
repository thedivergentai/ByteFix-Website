### Framer Motion Integration Guide

1.  **Install Framer Motion:**
    ```bash
    npm install motion
    ```
2.  **Import `motion`:** Import the `motion` component from `motion/react` in your `src/pages/index.js` file (or any component where you want to add animations).
    ```javascript
    import { motion } from "motion/react"
    ```
3.  **Use `motion` components:** Replace standard HTML elements with their `motion` counterparts (e.g., `motion.div`, `motion.h1`, `motion.button`).
4.  **Apply animation variants:** Define animation variants using the `variants` prop and apply them using the `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props.  For example:

    ```javascript
    const fadeIn = {
      hidden: { opacity: 0 },
      visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { duration: 0.5 } },
    }

    <motion.h1
      variants={fadeIn}
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
    >
      ByteFix
    </motion.h1>
    ```
5.  **Customize animations:**  Adjust animation properties (duration, delay, easing, etc.) within the `transition` object to achieve the desired effects.

*   The header is now sticky.
*   Basic form validation has been implemented.
